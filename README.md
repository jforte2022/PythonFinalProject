Final Python Project

1) Problem Description:
Hello, my final project will be a short text-based, turn-based role playing game in Python. The main difficulty with this will be creating a balanced game. Also, the "encounter" function will calculate damage from the player towards whatever enemies are in the game. The idea will be to have different stats that affect combat, the game's ending, and certain dialogue options. 

2) Related Work:
This project will be very similar in some ways to rock, paper, scissors. Depending on what in-game class you choose, certain encounters will be different. Hopefully, I will have time to add a few branching paths as well.

3) Problem Solution:
The main issues I anticipate having are designing a well-balanced encounter system. Lot's of tweaking will have to be done to the formula to have a somewhat balanced game. Also, writing the dialogue will probably take a while. After designing a "Combatant" class, I can create a loop that pits various "Combatants" against each other so I can see how the stats affect combat outcomes.
